        <h1>Sablekh Privacy Policy</h1>

        <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us</h3>
        
        <p>It is Sablekh's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to www.sablekh.com (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "www.sablekh.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.
This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms of Service posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms of service.</p>


        <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
        <p>Like most website operators, Sablekh collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Sablekh's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Sablekh's visitors use its website. From time to time, Sablekh may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Sablekh also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://www.sablekh.com blog posts. Sablekh only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

        <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
        <p>Certain visitors to Sablekh's websites choose to interact with Sablekh in ways that require Sablekh to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Sablekh gathers depend on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://www.sablekh.com to provide a username and email address.</p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h3>Advertisements</h3>
        <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Sablekh and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

        <h3>Links To External Sites</h3>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and Terms of service of every site you visit.

        <h3>Sablekh uses Google AdWords for remarketing</h3>
        <p>Sablekh uses the remarketing services to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site.

Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Sablekh discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order, or another governmental request, or when Sablekh believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Sablekh, third parties or the public at large.
