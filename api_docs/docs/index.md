## Introduction

 Sablekh is a web platform(for now) that enables users to post documents in the form of `library` i.e. a collection of documents and then retrieve it whenever necessary by searching or through customiable link.

## Basic Things about System

*  API uses `token-authentication`.
*  For now only files below `30MB` and not more than `10 files` in a library is allowed.
*  Anyone can search for libraries and download libraries, even without authentication but only authenticated users will be allowed to create library.


## Basic Steps

*  User will have to be authenticated to receive token which can then be used for authoriation throughout the site.
